# [World Cup Legacies](https://world-cup-legacies.vercel.app/)



This quarter long project for the class [Building News Appplications](https://data-driven.news/bna/2024/) (COMM 277T) explores the impact that the last three World Cups had on their host countries. Throughout this news app, our team focused on providing more information regarding the abandonement of stadiums in Brazil, the environmental impact in Russia, and the workers rights issues in Qatar. We spent a great amount of time both wrangling with data, as well as learning new technologies in order to implement vizualizations that make each page more interactive and enjoyable.
