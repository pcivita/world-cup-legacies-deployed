          Nestled between Poland, Lithuania, and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast is the westernmost 
          part of Russia, and is home to one former World Cup venueâ€”Kaliningrad Stadium. The stadium was 
          built in the three years preceding the tournament for an estimated cost of $200 million USD. It 
          has been plagued with difficulties since.

          Now known as Rostec Arena, the stadium was constructed on Oktyabrsky Island, an area surrounded by the Pregolya River in 
          Kaliningrad. It was also the last natural wetland in the city, a marshy region that protected 
          water-bird colonies from human development and helped filter pollution from the river. Over a 
          million tons of sand were poured over the swamp to stabilize the foundation for the construction 
          of the stadium. The project was completed in 2018, just in time for the World Cup.

          But if the stadium transformed the island for the worst, the island retaliated: not even a 
          year after the World Cup ended, the stadium was reportedly in danger of sinking due to the 
          unstable ground. After the Russian National Team played a match against Kazakhstan at Kaliningrad 
          Stadium towards the end of 2020, the sewage and drainage systems were found to be in poor condition, 
          leading to <Link className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"

          the ground where water had pushed up against the asphalt. The Moscow Times reported that the 
          government set aside 40 million rubles, or around $440,000 USD, to renovate the stadium in 2019, 
          but there is no record of that renovation occurring.

         Some blame the poor construction of the stadium on corruption. Financial troubles led the company 
         responsible for designing the stadium to declare bankruptcy, forcing the Russian government to step 
         in. Several high-ranking <Link className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://news.sky.com/story/world-cup-linked-oligarch-ziyavudin-magomedov-held-over-corruption-11311326">officials were arrested</Link> and charged with embezzling money from the stadium, 
         according to Sky News.
