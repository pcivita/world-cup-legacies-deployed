A README.md memo briefly describing:
What skill you set out to learn.
How you went about learning it. For example: links to specific tutorials, StackOverflow posts, code tinkering you performed, usage of the Developer Toolbar, etc. You're encouraged to embed code snippets in the README.md (here's how to embed code in Markdown).
Assessment of your degree of mastery. How well do you feel you have learned the technique? For example, could you code this technique again from memory or with minimal reference to documentation? Could you explain or teach it to someone else? If you don't feel like you've fully mastered the technique, what would be your next step(s) to deepen your understanding?
